## Description

Welcome to the QESST theme for WordPress. QESST was established in 2011 as an NSF-DOE funded Engineering Research Center. This theme contains design considerations consistent with the organization's mission and standing among the contributing universities.

## Installation

The QESST Theme for WordPress is a standalone theme for WordPress. It originated from the starter theme [Understrap](https://github.com/understrap/understrap). Periodic updates from the original can be selectively applied to this theme via `git pull` without overwriting the theme's customizations. 

## Inclusions & Dependencies

See the Understrap GitHub repo for all of the dependencies of the original theme. Noted additions are as follows:

- The theme uses Bootstrap's UI kit. The installed version is v4.3.1 and can be updaed via `composer` as needed.

- This theme includes the custom field library for WordPress called [Carbon Fields](https://carbonfields.net), which is licensed under the GNU General Public License. It is freely available.

- It also includes Font Awesome, v5.8.1. A license for this product is maintained by ASU Engineering.
